## Project summary

Diana is an app for reporting violence against women. Our app is disguised as a reading app, uses geolocation to make the report for greater user safety and has an artificial intelligence like chatbot to identify which type of violence the user is being victimized by. In addition to the report being anonymous (no need to register) and the application having a testimonial area where users can share their experiences after the report, thus also encouraging other victims to file the report.

The project aims to protect women from domestic violence.

The app is disguised as a reading app, after lauching it, you talk with our A.I., Diana, developed with [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs). Diana will identify what kind of violence the women is being victim, it can identify 5 types of violence: physic, psicologic, patrimonial, sexual and moral. The victim will be encouraged
to report (the anonymous report is available) the aggressor. This can be make by making a call or sending a text message to the police, in addition, the person can send a media to proof the agression: video, photo or an audio, this media will be sent to a [Cloudinary cloud](https://cloudinary.com/) and a link will return, which can be copied and be sent to the police in a text message. 
The app has a map tab, which you can see points of interest (like NGOs, police stations, social care places), a FAQ tab with questions and answers about the app, a testimonial area where you can share your experience and see what other users thnk about it, and finally, an about us screen, with informations about our team, the development tool, the [Technovation Girls Challenge](https://technovationchallenge.org/) and the app itself.
